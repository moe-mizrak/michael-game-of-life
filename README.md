Michael Game of Life


## TODO:

- [ ] `Create the main skeleton` by adding composer (needed for autoloading, and phpunit), index.php, phpunit.xml, .gitignore, .github/workflows, and folder structure
- [ ] `Write tests` and `start adding classes` (will be decided as I write the code)
- [ ] `Implement index.php` so that the results will be `shown in the console`
- [ ] `Add/improve docblocks` for the class and methods
- [ ] Add tests for the `edge cases`
- [ ] `Check the document` for the **game of life** if anything is missing or can be improved
- [ ] `Check the overall code` so that it can be improved regarding design patterns, KISS, YAGNI etc,, make sure to keep it clean, simple and easy to understand. Make sure `not to overengineer` it.
- [ ] Add github actions for automated testing
- [ ] Add code coverage for tests
- [ ] Add static analysis tools (phpstan etc), add them to github actions so that will automatically modify/lint the code when necessary
- [ ] `Update readme file` to show how to run the code, requirements such as php version etc. write a simple `usage section`.
- [ ] Maybe make it accept parameters from console for the sleep time, grid/cell size etc
